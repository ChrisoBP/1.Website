    <div class="content">
        <p>The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is an American single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics for the United States Air Force (USAF). Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft with over 4,600 built since 1976. Although no longer purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to Lockheed Martin.
            Because of War Experience in Vietnam the US Airforce realised it is  in dire need of new Air Superiority Fighters. It was the first aircraft that was engineered with mathimatics used to calculate the optimal shape for maximum Energy Retention.
            In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force it is also in use by the air forces of 25 other nations. It is the world's most common fixed-wing aircraft in military service, with 2145 F-16s operational.</p>

            Some noteworthy Features of the F-16 include: a frameless bubble canopy for enhanced cockpit visibility, a side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, the first use of a fly-by-wire flight control system that helps to make it an agile aircraft and Datalink to share information with other aircraft in the squadron, guide other missiles to theyre target, or have its missiles guided to the target by aircraft with better radar.
